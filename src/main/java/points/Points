Test methed have to follow general signature:
1. They have to be "public void"
2. One of the principles in test deriven development is we don't write any more code  than our test demands of us.
3. If we want to ignore a test method in JUnit 5 we put "@Disabled" on that method and in JUnit 4 we should put "@Ignore"
    instead.
4. A very good and important point about assertEquals message:
            //Better performance because string is not prepared for calling the method stack
            assertEquals(-2, result, () -> num1 + "-" + num2 + " is not equals to " + result);
            //It's not best practice because string is prepared for calling method even if Test is passd
            assertEquals(3, result, num1 + "-" + num2 + " is not equals to " + result)
